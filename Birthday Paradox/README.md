he Birthday Paradox, also called the Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high probability that two people will have the same birthday even in a small group of people. In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance of two people having a matching birthday. But even in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent chance of a matching birthday.
