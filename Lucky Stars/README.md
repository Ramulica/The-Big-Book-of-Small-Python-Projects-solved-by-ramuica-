###    In this push-your-luck game, you roll dice to collect stars. The more you roll, the more stars you can get, but if you get three skulls you lose everything! This quick multiplayer game can support as many players as you want, making it ideal for parties.

   On your turn, you pull three random dice from the dice cup and roll them. You can roll Stars, Skulls, and Question Marks. If you end your turn, you get one point per Star. If you choose to roll again, you keep the Question Marks and pull new dice to replace the Stars and Skulls. If you collect three Skulls, you lose all your Stars and end your turn.

   When a player gets 13 points, everyone else gets one more turn before the game ends. Whoever has the most points wins.
