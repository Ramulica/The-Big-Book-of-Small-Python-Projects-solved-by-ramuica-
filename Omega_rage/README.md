# Omeag Rage

---

### Instructions

Omega Rage is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the THING, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the THING through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. THING automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the touchscreen. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes awards the player one point. Colliding with a pipe or the ground ends the gameplay.
